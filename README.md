# js-vectors

A simple js library to handle 2D and 3D vectors.

I needed a way to easily manage vectors for a project and I couldn't find a library that I liked, so I made one.

## Installation

[Download the last build here](https://github.com/lorossi/js-vectors/releases/latest)

## Reference

[Check out the docs!](https://github.com/lorossi/js-vectors/blob/main/DOCS.md)

They include examples for each method.

## Websites using this library (so far)

- [lorenzoros.si](https://lorenzoros.si/) for the moving balls in the background
- [procedural-paintings](https://lorenzoros.si/procedural-paintings/) to handle all the particles
